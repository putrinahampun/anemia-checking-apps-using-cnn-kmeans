# Identification Of Anemia Through Conjunctival Eye Image Using K-Means Clustering And Convolutional Neural Network

## Project Description
üñºÔ∏è **Abstract :**
Anemia is a serious health problem that, if not promptly and accurately addressed, can lead to death. Anemia examinations can generally be performed invasively and noninvasively. Invasive examinations require time and expensive costs. The technical process of blood sampling can also cause discomfort, leading some people to hesitate in undergoing examinations. Meanwhile, non-invasive examinations only require observation of the paleness of the color on the conjunctival eye, which is considered far more effective than invasive examinations. However, human observation can be subjective, necessitating a system for identifying anemia using the K-Means Clustering and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods. The data used consisted 400 images for the training process and 40 images for the testing process. The research results show the system‚Äôs ability to recognize conjunctival eye images of individuals with 
anemia or non-anemia with an accuracy rate of 95%. 

üéØ **Target:** 

To identify anemia in images of the conjunctiva of the eye, use K-Means Clustering and Convolutional Neural Network methods so you can determine whether a person suffers from anemia or not and obtain recommendations appropriate initial treatment and prevention.

## Results
### Model Performance
In this task, some experiments and modifications were conducted on different versions of the ResNet architecture. The best results were achieved using the ResNet-18 architecture with additional Linear, ReLU, and Dropout layers. The optimal model was obtained by setting the parameters to **batch_size = 64, learning_rate = 0.0001, and epoch = 11**, resulting in an accuracy of **95%**.

## Additional Comments
üìå **Conclusions** 
- Use of the K-Means Clustering and CNN methods to identify anemia 
through the image of the conjunctiva the eye can work well with accuracy 
reaches 95%. 
- Segmentation with K-Means Clustering produces images with more noise 
a little bit, making it easier for CNN to recognize 
color in the image of the conjunctiva of the eye. 
- The model with the best performance is obtained by the learning rate parameter value 
0.0001, batch size 64, and total steps 400. 
- The system successfully carried out the identification process at a distance of ÔÇ± 8 cm. 
- Factors that can cause model prediction errors 
image is the lighting used, image quality, and distance 
shooting.

üìë**Future Work** 
- Use datasets with good quality and large quantities.
- Pay attention to several factors such as distance and light used 
taking images directly, to obtain more detailed images 
Good. 
- Testing different segmentation and classification methods 
with the method in this research. 
- Build a real-time detection system using the object detection method
